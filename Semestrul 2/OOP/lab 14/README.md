A pharmacy management application designed to streamline inventory tracking and prescription management. Developed in C/C++, the project focuses on efficient data handling and performance optimization using Valgrind. Key features include:

Inventory management: Track and update medication stock levels.

Prescription management: Manage patient prescriptions and refills.

Performance optimization: Utilized Valgrind to detect and fix memory leaks, ensuring robust and efficient code.

This project, developed as part of an academic course, highlights my ability to create practical and scalable solutions for real-world problems.
